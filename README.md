# LectureCloud

LectureCloud was a project for the Start NTNU hackathon 2020, sponsored by Cisco. It was made by:

 * Sondre Strand Haltbakk [https://github.com/sondreMOTE](https://github.com/sondreMOTE)
 * Andreas Jensen Jonassen [https://github.com/andreasjj](https://github.com/andreasjj)
 * Alexander Meldal Andersen [https://github.com/mittbrukernavn](https://github.com/mittbrukernavn)
 * Liam Svan√•sbakken crouch [https://github.com/petterroea](https://github.com/petterroea)

The theme for the hackathon was to create a solution to improve hybrid teaching - we solved it by improving the lecture-watching experience. We wrote this project in around 17 hours over a weekend - this is not production-ready in any way shape or form (hence our name, Prodbreakers).
